            <h2 className="text-3xl font-normal">Understanding SAP</h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed opacity-80">
              SAP, which stands for Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing, is the cornerstone of modern enterprise resource planning. Founded in 1972, it has evolved into a comprehensive software suite that integrates various business functions into a unified system. At its core, SAP provides a single platform where different departments can seamlessly share information and streamline their operations, fundamentally transforming how businesses operate in the digital age.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-normal">Core Capabilities</h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed opacity-80">
              The power of SAP lies in its comprehensive integration capabilities. The system excels at connecting various business processes, from finance and human resources to supply chain and customer relationship management. This integration ensures data flows seamlessly across departments, eliminating redundancies and reducing errors. What sets SAP apart is its real-time processing capability, providing businesses with immediate insights for faster, more informed decision-making.

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed opacity-80">
              Scalability is another crucial aspect of SAP's design. Whether implemented in a small enterprise or a global corporation, the system can be tailored to match specific business requirements. This flexibility allows organizations to start with essential modules and expand their SAP implementation as their needs grow and evolve.
